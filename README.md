# 🚀 git-to-know-me-ae

> A personal portfolio app built with **React Native + Supabase**, showcasing my journey as a Computer Science student.

## 📖 About the Project
This is not just another mobile app — it’s **me, in code form**.  
I wanted to create something that blends **practice** (databases, CRUD, authentication) with **creativity** (my vibe, coding moodboard, and personal touch).

**App Goals:**
- Serve as my interactive portfolio.
- Practice full-stack mobile development with Supabase.
- Share a glimpse of who I am as a CS student.
- Provide a structured space to showcase projects and interact with users.

## 🎨 Design Direction
- **Design Style:** Neobrutalism  
- **Color Palette:** Retro-inspired colors (warm pastels, bold blues, muted reds, off-whites)  
- **Typography:** Archivo Black / Typewriter font  
- **Mood:** Playful, minimal, and authentic
