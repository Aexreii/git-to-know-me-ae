# git-to-know-me-ae
CS Student Portfolio App (Mobile)  an app that introduces you — but in a more interactive, creative way than a boring static portfolio site.
# 🚀 git-to-know-me-ae

> A personal portfolio app built with **React Native + Supabase**, showcasing my journey as a Computer Science student.

## 📖 About the Project
This is not just another mobile app — it’s **me, in code form**.  
I wanted to create something that blends **practice** (databases, CRUD, authentication) with **creativity** (my vibe, coding moodboard, and personal touch).

**App Goals:**
- Serve as my interactive portfolio.
- Practice full-stack mobile development.
- Share a glimpse of who I am as a CS student.

---

## 🎯 Features
- 👨‍💻 **About Me** – My background, skills, and journey.
- 📂 **Projects Showcase** – My CS projects with links & descriptions.
- 📝 **Learning Journal** – Track my coding lessons and reflections.
- 🎨 **Coding Moodboard** – A creative space (quotes, snippets, playlists).
- 📬 **Contact / Links** – Quick links to GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React Native (Expo)** – Cross-platform mobile framework.
- **Supabase** – Backend (database, authentication, storage).
- **GitHub** – Version control & commits streak ✨.
- *(Future idea: AI-powered features — suggested add-ons later!)*
